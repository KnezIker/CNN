# CNN
## Project idea
The idea of this project is to make simple convolutional neural network (CNN), to train it in python and extract its weights and biases.
Then to put those weights and biases in c code, and run in on puplpissimo architecture in riscy core.
Then to determine which instructions are repeated the most and to make simple hardware accelerator in riscy core for those instructions
## CNN design
This cnn is basically the same as shown in this youtube tutorial:

It consists of 5 layeers
